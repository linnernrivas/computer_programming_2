/*Write an interface ObjectWithOneParameter which has the following methods---
 * Methods: (1) surfaceArea (double p)Ñreturns the surface area of a particular object                 
 * (2) volume (double p)Ñreturns the volume of a particular object   
 * Write two classes CubeClass and SphereClass which implement the interface you created.  
 * Write a Demo class which creates objects of CubeClass and SphereClass 
 * and call the corresponding methods. */
